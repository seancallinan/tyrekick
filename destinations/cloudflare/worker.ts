/**
 * Tyrekick — Cloudflare Worker / Pages Function destination.
 *
 * This is the "owned storage" template. It receives the JSON `FeedbackPayload`
 * that the widget POSTs (with the default `transport: "json"`) and stores each
 * record in Workers KV so you can keep, sort, and export feedback yourself.
 *
 * It exposes two faces:
 *
 *   INGEST (open — reviewers stay frictionless):
 *     POST /            — accept a FeedbackPayload (back-compat root route)
 *     POST /feedback    — same
 *     GET  /            — health summary ("yes, this is a live Tyrekick
 *                         destination"), so pasting the worker URL into a
 *                         browser doesn't look like a broken deploy
 *
 *   MANAGEMENT (token-gated — `Authorization: Bearer <TYREKICK_TOKEN>`):
 *     GET   /feedback?status=&route=&since=&limit=  — list, newest first
 *     GET   /feedback/:id                           — single full record
 *     PATCH /feedback/:id                           — triage (approve/decline) / resolve / reopen
 *
 *   REVIEWER-FACING (browser, no login):
 *     GET   /receipts?ids=…    — status of comments you submitted (capability ids)
 *     GET   /shared?project=…  — every reviewer's pins, if TYREKICK_REVIEW_KEY is set
 *
 * The management surface is the REST API that the tyrekick-mcp
 * MCP server talks to (see /mcp in the repo), so an AI agent can pull the
 * feedback back out and act on it.
 *
 * KV layout:
 *   key       = "fb:<payload.id>"
 *   value     = full stored record JSON (payload + server fields)
 *   metadata  = { t: created_at, s: status, r: route }
 * Listing/filtering reads metadata only; record bodies are fetched just for
 * the page being returned. (KV list caps at 1000 keys per call — fine for
 * prototype scale; D1 is the upgrade path.)
 *
 * It works two ways with the SAME code:
 *   1. As a standalone Worker (cross-origin): the widget on another domain POSTs
 *      here, so we send permissive CORS headers and handle the OPTIONS preflight.
 *   2. As a Cloudflare Pages Function next to your static prototype
 *      (same-origin): CORS is then irrelevant, but the headers are harmless,
 *      so the same file drops in unchanged. See README.md.
 *
 * Bindings: KV namespace `FEEDBACK` + secret `TYREKICK_TOKEN` (see wrangler.toml).
