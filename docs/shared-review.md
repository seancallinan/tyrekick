# Guide: shared review

**What it does:** turns a review from N private conversations into one shared
page — every reviewer sees every other reviewer's pins (read-only, attributed),
instead of only their own. Reviewers stop reporting the same thing four times.

**When to use it:** a **private** link shared with a handful of people you
trust. **Not** a public URL — see the trade below.

**Cost/effort:** one worker secret + one widget attribute. Worker destination
only (Discord has no read-back).

---

## Read this before you enable it

Shared review works by putting a **review key in your page**, which the widget
sends to the worker to read everyone's pins. Because the key ships in the page,
it is **public to anyone holding the review link**. Enabling shared review
means:

> **Anyone who can open the prototype can read every comment left on it,
> including reviewer names.**

That's the right trade for a private link to people you trust. It's the **wrong
trade for a public URL** (a LinkedIn post, a public demo) — you'd be publishing
your reviewers' feedback, and any spam, to every visitor. On a public share,
leave it off (the default). See [Taking a prototype public](going-public.md).

There's no finer-grained scoping available — reviewers never log in, which is
the whole point of Tyrekick. The key is a door for a private link, not a secret
password. If you need the *page itself* behind a password, that is a separate
door: see [Page password](page-password.md).

## Setup (private link)

### 1. Set the key on your worker

```bash
npx wrangler secret put TYREKICK_REVIEW_KEY    # paste `openssl rand -hex 32`
npx wrangler deploy                            # add -c wrangler.local.toml if you use one
```

Until this secret is set, the `/shared` route returns `404` — the feature is off
and doesn't even advertise itself.

### 2. Put the same key on the widget

Auto-init (script tag):

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tyrekick@latest/dist/tyrekick.js"
  data-webhook="https://your-worker.workers.dev/feedback"
  data-app-version="v0.1"
  data-project-name="my-prototype"
  data-review-key="the-same-long-random-string"
></script>
```

ESM:

```ts
init({
  webhook: "https://your-worker.workers.dev/feedback",
  appVersion: "v0.1",
  projectName: "my-prototype",
  reviewKey: "the-same-long-random-string",
});
```

The value must match the worker secret exactly.

### 3. Set a stable `projectName`

Shared review is scoped by `projectName`. Use an explicit, stable, kebab-case
value — the same on the widget and across every redeploy. The `document.title`
fallback silently forks your feedback stream the first time you edit the title,
and preview hosts mint a new origin per deploy, so `projectName` is the only
durable identity the shared view has.

## Verify

```bash
WORKER=https://your-worker.workers.dev
KEY=your-review-key

# with the key → 200, your pins:
curl -H "X-Tyrekick-Review-Key: $KEY" "$WORKER/shared?project=my-prototype"
# → {"ok":true,"count":0,"total":0,"pins":[]}

# without the key → 401:
curl -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "$WORKER/shared?project=my-prototype"
```

If the secret isn't set you'll get `404` (feature off). Once it's set and the
widget carries the matching `data-review-key`, open the page in two browsers,
comment in one — the pin appears in the other, attributed, within ~60s.

## What reviewers see (and don't)

- Another reviewer's pin renders read-only, labelled with their name (or
  "Another reviewer" if they left the name blank). You can reply, but replies go
  to your destination like any comment — not peer-to-peer.
- **Declined comments are withheld** from the shared view. Declining a comment
  (via MCP or the API) is therefore how you clear spam and noise from
  *everyone's* page. Its author still learns the outcome on their own pin.
- Other reviewers never see your user agent / device fingerprint, the page's
  errors, the full URL (share links can carry query secrets), or your session
  id — the `/shared` response is a deliberate projection.

## Comment numbers

Every reviewer sees the same number on the same comment, and that number does
not change. The worker assigns it from the page's whole history in the order
comments arrived, so a new comment always takes the next number and never
disturbs one already given out.

**Declining leaves a gap.** Decline #2 of five and the page shows 1, 3, 4, 5 —
it does not slide everything up. That is deliberate: numbers get quoted. The
widget writes one into the `Re #N:` prefix of every reply, and reviewers say
"see #4" to each other, so a missing number is honest where a reused one
silently changes what an old message meant.

A comment you have written but not yet sent, or one whose send failed, is
numbered above every assigned number until it arrives.

Two cases fall back to counting, and numbers there can still shift: the Discord
transport, which has nothing to read back from, and workers older than 0.6. If
your numbers move after a decline, redeploy your worker.

## Revoke or disable

Rotate or delete the worker secret — no page edit needed:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put TYREKICK_REVIEW_KEY    # new value → old links can't read
# or
npx wrangler secret delete TYREKICK_REVIEW_KEY # feature off entirely
npx wrangler deploy
```
