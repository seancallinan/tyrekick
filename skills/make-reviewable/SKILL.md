description: >
  Wire Tyrekick review into the current web project and summon human feedback
  with one sentence. Use when the user says "make this reviewable", "get
  feedback on this", "add tyrekick", "let people comment on this", "get eyes
  on this", "ask <someone> to look at this", or when a prototype you just
  built/deployed needs human review. Gives the app a home first if it doesn't
  have one (deploys a static artifact / generated HTML file to Cloudflare Pages,
  or tunnels a local-only app), then installs the feedback widget, chooses and
  (if needed) deploys the right destination (Discord taster vs Cloudflare Worker
  loop, with optional Discord mirroring), wires the MCP read-back, and drafts the
  ask message to send reviewers.

# make-reviewable

Goal: from "make this reviewable, ask Dave to check the checkout" to a live,
instrumented page **plus a ready-to-paste ask message**, in one pass. The
human should never have to know what a webhook, worker, or token is.

## 1. Gather facts (ask at most ONE question)

Check before asking anything:

- **Already installed?** Grep the HTML entry for `data-webhook` or
  `tyrekick`. If present, skip to step 6 (the ask) — never redirect an
  existing destination. One check first: run `npx tyrekick status`. If the
  Review row says closed, the endpoint refuses new comments, so run
  `npx tyrekick reopen --days 14` before you send anyone the link (same URL,
  same store). See step 5.
- **Previous decisions?** Check the project's CLAUDE.md (or equivalent) for a
  recorded Tyrekick destination / project slug. Reuse them.
- **Does the app even have a home?** The loop needs the page to load from an
  **http(s) origin** — a `file://` artifact, an emailed HTML file, or a
  script-generated page with no host CANNOT send feedback out or get receipts
  back. Classify:
  - **hosted** — already at an http(s) URL (deployed, or a dev server reviewers
    can reach). Note the URL; no hosting needed.
  - **unhosted** — a static build, a single generated HTML file, or anything
    only openable via `file://`. It has no origin → **give it one in step 2.**
- **Where does this deploy?** Infer from the repo: `netlify.toml`,
  `vercel.json`, `wrangler.toml`, `CNAME`, gh-pages workflows, or the user's
  own words. Classify:
  - **private** — localhost, LAN, a tunnel the user just opened
  - **public** — any preview/static host URL or real domain
- **Project slug**: kebab-case of the folder name unless one is recorded.
  Chosen ONCE, never derived from the page title, never changed.
- **App version**: `git rev-parse --short HEAD` (fallback `v0.1`).

If no destination is recorded and you cannot infer hosting, ask the one
question: *"Where will this be hosted (just locally / a public URL), and do
you have a Discord channel you'd like feedback mirrored to?"*

## 2. Give the app a home (only if it doesn't have one)

Skip this whole step if the app is **hosted** already — use its URL. Do it if
the app is **unhosted** (a `file://` artifact, a generated HTML file, a static
build with no host). The feedback loop cannot work from `file://`; the page
needs a real origin. **Inject the widget FIRST (steps 3–5 below), then host the
copy that carries it.**

Prereq for Pages/tunnel: `npx wrangler whoami` — if unauthenticated, ask the
human to run `npx wrangler login` (you can't do it for them).

Pick by who's reviewing:

- **Remote reviewers, static page/build** → deploy the folder as a Cloudflare
  Worker with static assets. Write a `wrangler.jsonc` at the project root (not
  in the folder with the feedback worker's `wrangler.toml`), then deploy; the
  printed `<slug>.<account>.workers.dev` URL is the review link:
  ```jsonc
  { "name": "<slug>", "compatibility_date": "<today, YYYY-MM-DD>", "assets": { "directory": "./<dir>" } }
  ```
  ```bash
  npx wrangler deploy
  ```
  Do not use `wrangler pages deploy`: Cloudflare folded Pages into Workers, and
  on current wrangler that command either delegates to `wrangler deploy` or
  fails with "project does not exist" when given `--branch`. If `<dir>` is the
  project root, add a `.assetsignore` listing `wrangler.jsonc`, `.wrangler`,
  `node_modules`, `.git` and `.tyrekick.json` so they are not uploaded.
- **Remote reviewers, a local-only running app** (e.g. a Python/Flask server) →
  open a tunnel to it:
  ```bash
  npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<port>   # prints a public https URL
  ```
- **You / same machine only** → serving locally is enough
  (`python3 -m http.server`, or the app's own dev server). Use the
  `http://localhost:<port>` URL — **never `file://`.**

Notes:
- **Regenerated each run?** (e.g. a script emits the HTML) — re-inject the
  widget and re-deploy/re-tunnel after each build. The review URL refreshes; the
  feedback worker + MCP from later steps stay put.
- **Same-origin shortcut:** if the app already serves its own pages (a
  Python/Node server), it can *be* the destination — add a `POST /feedback`
  route, point the widget at the relative `/feedback` (no CORS), and either skip
  the separate worker or have that route forward to it.

## 3. Choose the destination

| Situation | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| Private host, user just wants comments to land in chat | Discord webhook directly (`data-transport="discord"`) — the 60-second taster; write-only, no agent loop |
| Anything public, OR the user wants the agent to read/fix feedback | **Cloudflare Worker** (deploy it yourself — step 4), with `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` mirroring if they have a channel |
| Public host + user offers a raw Discord webhook | Refuse the raw webhook (it's visible in page source = spam cannon). Deploy the worker and set their Discord as the mirror — they lose nothing. |

Default when in doubt: the worker. It is the actual product loop; Discord
alone is the demo of it.

## 4. Deploy the worker (when chosen)

Prereq: `npx wrangler whoami` — if unauthenticated, stop and ask the human to
run `npx wrangler login` (interactive; you cannot do it for them).

**`whoami` passing is not enough to create KV.** Since 2026-08-22 Cloudflare
grants OAuth scopes individually: only *User Read* and *Background Access* are
Required on the consent screen, and **KV Write** is an *Additional Access*
toggle. A login without it fails step 2 below with a bare
`Authentication error [code: 10000]` that names no scope, while `wrangler deploy`
keeps working — so nothing looks broken until KV.
The local `scopes` line in `~/Library/Preferences/.wrangler/config/default.toml`
records what Wrangler *requested*, not what was granted; don't treat it as proof.
Pinning an older Wrangler doesn't help either.

If KV 401s, don't diagnose it as a billing or account problem. Ask the human for
one of:

- `npx wrangler login` again, turning on **KV Write** (or **Full access**), or
- a **CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN** from the *Edit Cloudflare Workers* template
  (includes Workers KV Storage:Edit). Have them write it to a file outside the
  repo — `~/.tyrekick/cloudflare.env`, `chmod 600` — so it stays out of the
  transcript, then `set -a; . ~/.tyrekick/cloudflare.env; set +a` before each
  wrangler call. Shell state does not persist between your tool calls.

An API token is the better default for agent-driven setup: it can't be silently
narrowed by a consent screen the human clicked through.

Get the template (three files: `worker.ts`, `wrangler.toml`, `README.md`):

1. If this repo IS tyrekick or already vendors it: use
   `destinations/cloudflare/` in place.
2. Otherwise copy into `tools/tyrekick-worker/` from either:
   - `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tyrekick@latest/destinations/cloudflare/{worker.ts,wrangler.toml}`
   - or raw GitHub: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardofortune/tyrekick/main/destinations/cloudflare/{worker.ts,wrangler.toml}`

Then, from the template directory:

```bash
# 1. Unique worker name (one worker per project keeps data tidy)
#    edit wrangler.toml:  name = "tyrekick-<project-slug>"

# 2. KV namespace — paste the printed id over REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID
#    Titles are unique per account, so plain "FEEDBACK" errors once a second
#    project exists. The binding stays FEEDBACK; only the title is per-project.
npx wrangler kv namespace create <project-slug>-FEEDBACK

# 2b. Default stand-down. Set the review window to 14 days out BEFORE the first
#     deploy, so it costs no extra deploy. An open ingest endpoint that nobody
#     is watching accepts anonymous writes forever.
#     edit wrangler.toml:  TYREKICK_OPEN_UNTIL = "<now + 14 days, ISO-8601 Z>"
#     Compute the instant yourself and write it into the existing [vars] block.
#     Leaving it "" is valid and means the review never closes.

# 3. Deploy (prints the workers.dev URL — record it)
npx wrangler deploy

# 4. Management token (never commit it; never echo it into chat logs)
TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
printf '%s' "$TOKEN" | npx wrangler secret put TYREKICK_TOKEN

# 5. Optional Discord mirror — every comment also pings their channel
printf '%s' "$DISCORD_URL" | npx wrangler secret put DISCORD_WEBHOOK
```

Verify before moving on:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://tyrekick-<slug>.<acct>.workers.dev/feedback \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"schema":2,"id":"'$(uuidgen)'","created_at":"'$(date -u +%FT%TZ)'","project_name":"<slug>","app_version":"test","route":"/","url":"skill-verify","body":"Worker verification from make-reviewable","kind":"verification","reviewer_name":null,"session_id":"'$(uuidgen)'","anchor":{"x_pct":0,"y_pct":0,"selector":null,"viewport":{"w":0,"h":0},"element":null,"context":{"heading":null,"landmark":null}},"env":{"user_agent":"skill","language":"en","screen":{"w":0,"h":0},"dpr":1,"dark":false,"touch":false},"page_errors":[]}'
# expect {"ok":true,...}  — "kind":"verification" makes it land already resolved,
#                            so it never shows up as an open comment nobody wrote

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://tyrekick-<slug>.<acct>.workers.dev/feedback?limit=1
# expect the record back
```

A `403 {"ok":false,"error":"review_closed"}` from that POST is not a broken
deploy: it means the review window you set has already lapsed (check the instant
you wrote in step 2b). Run `npx tyrekick reopen --days 14` and verify again.

If the user has a Discord mirror set, tell them a verification message just
appeared in their channel.

## 5. Install the widget + MCP

```bash
npx tyrekick init --webhook <DESTINATION_URL> --yes --project <slug>
```

(`--transport discord` only for the direct-Discord taster; worker URLs are
auto-detected as JSON. Use `--file <path>` if the HTML entry is unusual.)

For worker destinations, register the read-back so "fix what people flagged"
works in every future session:

```bash
claude mcp add tyrekick \
  --env TYREKICK_URL=<worker base URL, no /feedback> \
  --env TYREKICK_TOKEN=$TOKEN \
  -- npx tyrekick-mcp
```

**Password-protect the page?** Only if the human asked for it (or the prototype
is clearly not for strangers and it is hosted as a Cloudflare static site from
step 2). Add `--password "<pw>"` to the `init` line above, or run
`npx tyrekick lock --password "<pw>"` from the project root afterwards. Either
writes `tyrekick-gate.js`, wires it into `wrangler.jsonc` (`main`,
`assets.binding`, `assets.run_worker_first`), sets the `PAGE_PASSWORD` secret
and runs `wrangler deploy`, so the lock is live when it returns. Cloudflare
static sites only (tunnels and GitHub Pages get nothing), and it gates viewing
the page, not the feedback worker. Put the password in the ask, never in a
committed file. Details: `docs/page-password.md`.

`init` also bookmarks worker destinations in `~/.tyrekick/deployments.json`
(outside any repo, no secrets in it: worker URL, project slug, date added), so
`npx tyrekick status --all` can later list every review this machine has wired
and probe which are still open. Nothing to write by hand; running `init` is what
registers it. If you wired a worker without `init`, run `npx tyrekick status`
once in the project directory and it registers there.

**Shipping a second wave?** If this project already has a worker and you are
shipping a fix for a review that has closed, do NOT redeploy the worker and do
NOT deploy a new one. Run `npx tyrekick reopen --days 14` from the project
directory. The URL, the KV store and every stored comment stay exactly where
they are, so the link you already sent reviewers still works. Use
`npx tyrekick close` when the wave is done.

If the app was **unhosted**, host it now (step 2) — deploy/serve the copy that
now carries the widget, and use *that* URL as the review link.

Record in the project's CLAUDE.md: the project slug, the review URL (and how
it's hosted — Pages project / tunnel / dev server), the destination URL,
transport, worker name, and where the token lives (wrangler secret — do NOT
write the token itself into any committed file).

For **worker destinations**, also write a `.tyrekick.json` at the project root so
dashboards (e.g. dev-hub's Review panel) can discover the feedback Worker and
surface open comments:

```json
{
  "slug": "<project-slug>",
  "workerUrl": "<worker base URL, no /feedback>",
  "liveUrl": "<review URL>"
}
```

It holds no secret, but treat it as **per-deployment config, not shared code**:
if the repo is cloned and run by others, gitignore `.tyrekick.json` (and gate the
widget mount behind an env var) so a stranger's app doesn't post to this Worker
and their clone doesn't inherit this deployment's store. Commit it only for a
private/single-owner repo where that association is wanted. A dashboard reads the
token separately from its own server-side env (`TYREKICK_TOKEN`, or
`TYREKICK_TOKEN_<slug>` for a per-project override), never from this file. Skip
`.tyrekick.json` for Discord-only taster destinations, since there is no
queryable Worker for a dashboard to read back.

## 6. Draft the ask (this is the actual product)

The widget collects; the ASK summons. Always end by producing a
ready-to-paste message for wherever the humans live, addressed to anyone the
user named:

```
Hey <names> — <one line on what this is / what changed, e.g. "new checkout flow on the trip planner">.

👉 <live URL>

Look at: <the specific pages/flows to review — from the user's request or your build context>
To comment: click the round button (bottom-right), then click the thing you're
commenting on and type. No login, ~10 seconds. Everything you flag comes
straight to <me / the agent / the Discord channel>.
```

Print it, and offer: "Want me to tighten the 'look at' list or address it to
someone else?"

## 7. Report

Tell the human, in plain words: the one URL to share (and, if you hosted it,
where it now lives), where feedback goes, whether their agent can read it back
(worker: yes / Discord-only: no — and how to upgrade later), when the review
stops accepting comments (the 14-day window from step 2b, and that
`npx tyrekick reopen --days 14` reopens it on the same URL), whether the page
has a password (and that it went into the ask, not a file), and the drafted
ask. If anything failed (wrangler auth, Pages/tunnel, KV create, test POST),
say exactly which step and what you need.

## Guardrails

- Never send test comments to a real channel/store without saying so first.
- Never commit tokens; never print a token into the conversation once stored.
- Never put a raw Discord webhook on a public page; never proxy feedback
  through servers the owner doesn't control.
- Feedback destinations belong to the project owner — don't redirect ones
  that already exist.
- Full behaviour reference: `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` in the tyrekick repo
  (`github.com/richardofortune/tyrekick`).
